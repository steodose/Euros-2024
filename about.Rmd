How this works
============

The below documents a relatively simple model for forecasting Premier League results, and is based on work previously done by [Luke Benz](https://lukebenz.com/post/wc_model_methodology/blogpost/) and [David Sheehan](https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/football/r/predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling/).

Building the model
------------

From a high level the model works as follows: We identify the goal scoring and conceding rates of each team, then use these ratings to forecast the expected number of goals to be scored in matches that haven't taken place yet. These expected goals are used to calculate the probabilities of the various outcomes (home win, draw, away win), which assumes the number of goals scored in soccer follow a Poisson distribution. From there we simulate these results with the predicted probabilities 10,000 times to identify the most likely outcomes for the season.

The model gives coefficients for each country both as levels of the team and opponent factors. Since the model output predictions can be taken as the average team_score for a given team against a given opponent at a given location, we can view the country specific coefficients as offense and defensive components of a power rating. Higher offensive coefficients indicate a team is likely to score more goals on average while low (more negative) defensive coefficients indicate a team is likely to concede fewer goals on average.

Goals scoring in soccer is known to follow a Poisson distribution. Thus if we plug these figures into a Poisson model, we get the following match predictions

Germany Win | Draw | Romania Win
--- | --- | ---|
14% | 18% | 64% 

Simulating all season fixtures
------------

The above shows how we get to probabilities for individual match outcomes. Next, we use these outcomes to simulate an entire season...10,000 times. For this model we're using independent Poisson distributions with means `ExpHG` and `ExpAG` to simulate results from. 

For matches that have yet to be played we assume the standard league format where each team plays all other teams home and away. We create all these possible combinations between the league teams in a dataframe, removing the cases where a team plays itself, and look for combinations which have not already been played. This is where we replicate Taylor's approach to get the expected scoring rates `ExpHG` and `ExpAG`.

From there we run the season simulation 10,000 times and initialize the results table named `df.all`, where for each iteration, the remaining season results are simulated and `Total Points`, `Goal Difference`, and a rankings table is constructed based on points and goal difference.
